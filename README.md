# Zuse Examples

Zuse **may eventually be** a ZeroMQ-based API (C++ binding) modeled on the [finite-state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine). However I'm no longer working on it as my plans to use ZeroMQ have changed, making this redundant.

This project *currently* contains 'sketches' of how Zuse might be used, but the intention has been to turn them into working examples.

The examples are based on those provided in the [ZeroMQ guide](http://zguide.zeromq.org/).

## Calculating Space

The Zuse project got its name from [Konrad Zuse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konrad_Zuse) on the basis that **a)** [Zuse proposed that the universe is being computed by some sort of cellular automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculating_Space) and **b)** many of the [ZeroMQ](https://github.com/zeromq) projects that I've seen start with the letter *Z* by convention.
